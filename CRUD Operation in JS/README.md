### About Practical
CRUD stands for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete. In the context of a product management system, CRUD operations refer to the basic functions that allow users to manage product data.

**Create:** This operation allows users to add new products to the system by entering relevant information such as product name, description, price, and other attributes.

**Read:** This operation allows users to view and retrieve product information from the system. This could include searching for products based on specific criteria or browsing through a list of all available products.

**Update:** This operation allows users to modify or update existing product information, such as changing the price, updating the product description, or adding new product attributes.

**Delete:** This operation allows users to remove products from the system. When a product is deleted, it should be permanently removed from the database and any associated data (such as sales history or inventory levels) should also be updated accordingly.

Overall, CRUD operations are essential for managing product data in a product management system and allow users to efficiently create, view, update, and delete products as needed.
